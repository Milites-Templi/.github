# 🛡️ Milites Templi

**Milites Templi** is a Flemish historical reenactment group dedicated to exploring and bringing to life the world of the medieval Templars.  
Through living history, experimental archaeology, and immersive public displays, we aim to deepen understanding of the material culture, values, and daily life of the Order of the Temple.
